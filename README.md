### Wordpress RAD Framework (DEV/Beta Mode)

**PLEASE NOTE: THIS FRAMEWORK IS PUBLIC BETA**

Rapid Developing Framework for Wordpress Plugins includes basis functionality for:

* Easy plugin boot-strapping
* Loose coupling of components
* Plugin configuration handling with custom user overwriting possibilities
* Plugin MVC architecture with controller, view and template classes
* Wordpress class wrapper for wp option handling
* Cache Library with different drivers
* Shortcut function for fast access
* Error and exception handling and logging
* ... and more

### Install

either by composer install with:

```javascript
"repositories": [{
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/setcooki/wp"
}]
,
"require": {
    "php": ">=5.3.3",
    "setcooki/wp": "@dev",
}
```

or download manual zip and use framework without composer support.

### Bootstrap

to initialize framework you need to include the /core.php file. if you use composer the most likely way of bootstrapping
and loading the framework would be like:

```php
define('SETCOOKI_WP_AUTOLOAD', 0);
require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/lib/vendor/autoload.php';
require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/lib/vendor/setcooki/wp/core.php';
```

if you dont use composer install and composer autoloader it probably would look like:

```php
define('SETCOOKI_WP_AUTOLOAD', 1);
require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/lib/setcooki/wp/core.php';
```

### Usage

The most likely szenario developing wordpress plugins with this framework is to extend from the `Setcooki\Wp\Plugin` class
and init the plugin from your plugin file that gets bootstrapped/loaded from wordpress once plugin is activated. The base
plugin class comes with minimum needed plugin functionality to get you kick-started. Extend from that class and implement
your basic plugin functionality

```php
class MyPlugin extends \Setcooki\Wp\Plugin
{
    public $options = array();

    public function __construct($options = null)
    {
        parent::__construct($options)
    }
    
    public function init()
    {
        //init your plugin logic
    }

    public function activate()
    {
        //your plugin activation logic
    }
    
    public function deactivate()
    {
        //your plugin deactivation logic
    }
    
    public function uninstall()
    {
        //your plugin uninstall logic
    }
}
```

Bootstrap your plugin in your `/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin/my-plugin.php` plugin file forwarding wpÂ´s 'init' hook to your
plugin class which needs to extend from `\Setcooki\Wp\Plugin` and which needs to call `parent::__construct($options)` in
class constructor. Your plugin logic starts when wp calls your plugins 'init' method.  

```php
if(function_exists('add_action'))
{
    $options = array
    (
        //your plugin options
    );
    add_action('init', array(new MyPlugin($options), 'init'));
}
```

to bootstrap multiple instances of same plugin in a multi-site wp environment modify bootstrapping to:

```php
if(function_exists('add_action'))
{
    $blog_id = get_current_blog_id(); //or whatever id you want the instance to be created under
    $options = array
    (
        //plugin options (which can be different for each instance) 
    );
    add_action('init', array(MyNamespace\MyPlugin::instance($blog_id, $options), 'init'));
}
```
